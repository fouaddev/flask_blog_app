# Light Weight robust Blog App:
This is a modern blog web application built using HTML5 and CSS3 and Bootstrap 3 for front-end, with the Flask framework for the back-end.

## Features:
- CRUD functionalities.
- Authentication.

## Requirements for running the App:
You will need to install Python 3 and several frameworks you can find in the templates folder.
You should have pip installed on your computer (if you have python 3 installed, it comes with it automatically),
and also the database SQLite (If you don't have it, download and install it from here: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
For installing the external packages, pip (or conda) works great.



## To run the app on the command line (ie: CMD or Shell):
### Step 1:
Install flask with the following command:
pip install flask

### Step 2:
Install flask-sqlalchemy with the following command:
pip install flask-sqlalchemy

### Step 3:
Unzip the zip folder of my app.
Now open your command line, and make sure your current directory is the app folder directory.

### Step 4:
Run the app.py file inside my app folder as follows:
```
python app.py
```

### Step 5:
Open your browser and go to your localhost host address to see the app (in my case it is by default localhost:5000)
